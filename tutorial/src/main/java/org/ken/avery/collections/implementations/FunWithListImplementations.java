     * advantage of System.arraycopy when it has to move multiple elements at
     * the same time. Think of ArrayList as Vector without the synchronization
     * overhead.

     * refers to the number of elements the ArrayList can hold before it has to
     * grow.

     * Positional access requires linear-time in a LinkedList and constant-time
     * in an ArrayList. Furthermore, the constant factor for LinkedList is much
     * worse. If you think you want to use a LinkedList, measure the performance
     * of your application with both LinkedList and ArrayList before making your
     * choice; ArrayList is usually faster.
